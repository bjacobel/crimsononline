"a newspaper website, written in Django"

Github clone of [the Crimson's Django project](https://code.google.com/p/crimson-online/), originally hosted on Google Code and abandoned in 2012. I thought I'd see if I could get it working again.

#####Setup:
1. `git clone git@github.com:bjacobel/crimsononline.git`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `brew install sqlite`
3. `manage.py syncdb --noinput`
4. `manage.py runserver`
